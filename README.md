# TimeSeries_fastai

This repository is aims to implement TimeSeries classification/regression algorithms.

## Installation


In short, if you have anaconda, execute:
```
$ conda env create --file=environment.yml
$ conda activate timseries
$ jupyter notebook
```

## Notebook 01

This is a basic notebook that implements the Deep Learning models proposed in [Time Series Classification from Scratch with Deep Neural Networks: A Strong Baseline](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.06455)

I fine tuned the resnet architecture to get better results than the paper, and to be able to train faster.
